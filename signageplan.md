## EXAMPLE markdown project plan for signage audit

This is a small project that flows mostly sequentially, so it does not need a complicated proposal or plan. This document is to demo the functionality of markdown for project plans. 

<details>
<summary>SCOPE & OBJECTIVES</summary>

The objective is to systematically assess signage on the 3rd floor and update signage to make the collections and space more usable. In the process, we will build a tool to track signage long term.

The scope of this project is signage and information related to collections, library materials, and use of 3rd floor library spaces. We will also be inventorying and documenting institutional and other signage on the 3d floor.

We should also try to develop a glossary of terms and some new style guidance as we work.

A proposal or charter is not necessary in this case.

<summary>PLANNING</summary>

The rest of this document reflects the stages of the plan produced. This section would hold information about staff, stakeholders, communication, cost and risk (if applicable).

I will continue to experiment with markup languages and planning visualizations for timelines, dependencies, flow and so on. 

General timeline:
- Our goals depend on the capacity of our incoming Communications Specialist, who will be important in the implementation stage. With different staffing capacity, the goal would have been to implement new signage by the beginning of Fall semester 2025 (August 21), which is not realistic. A more realistic goal is to implement new signage in September.

Here is an example of a list:

1. Inventory, analyze
2. Research and test for usability
3. Design and implement the new
4. Monitor and test in real life use
5. Create a plan for maintenance
6. Decide where to go next

<summary>INVENTORY & ANALYSIS</summary>

We're building a spreadsheet to facilitate this process. The spreadsheet can/will also serve as a permanent database of signage where we can track maintenance.
